TESTUDO is an offline, signing only crytocurrency wallet.

In this repository, you will find source code contained in the Eclipse project TestudoSource.
External libraries used in Testudo can be found in the folder named such.


IMPORTANT: This wallet is intended for offline use only, and use on a potentially compromised online system will significantly
increase the risk of key theft and signature alteration.
